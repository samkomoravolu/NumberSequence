# NumberSequence

For a long time, Iâ€™ve dreamed of applying the math and physics I learned in school to create a product that will be able to help people in significant ways. Since I discovered a passion for computer science and machine learning, I sought to find opportunities that could teach me the best industry practices, so that one day I could call one of those wildly successful artificial intelligence projects my own. As a student in my first computational science class, I was astonished by how much mathematics alone could accomplish in the field of artificial intelligence, and wanted to create my own machine learning project from scratch, relying on no external libraries. My project uses regression and recurrent neural networks to accurately predict number patterns such as exponential functions, arithmetic progressions and sine waves. I implemented a gradient descent algorithm to train the weights of the RNN, modeling each element as a linear combination of previous elements and incorporating a bias node and activation function. I chose this project not because it always arrives at the right answer, but rather because I implemented the software from scratch based on raw mathematics.
